# Web Scraping and Storing Articles from BBC Russian

This project involves a Python script that extracts articles from the BBC Russian website and stores them in an SQLite database. The script uses web scraping techniques to collect article content and ensures that duplicate articles are not stored in the database. The project is designed to run automatically and can be scheduled to scrape and update articles periodically.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `requests` library for making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` library for HTML parsing
- `sqlite3` library for working with SQLite databases
